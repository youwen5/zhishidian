A site I made during COVID to help friends and family communicate through a shared Twitter-like service.

The UI stack is React + Material UI, with AWS serverless Lambda functions and a MySQL database to provide backend services.
It has authentication and stores the passwords appropriately with salting and hashing.

Currently no longer functional because the associated AWS resources shut down.

## Development instructions

This project is powered by `create-react-app`.

1. Clone and run `npm install`
2. Run `npm start` to start the development server at `localhost:3000`.
